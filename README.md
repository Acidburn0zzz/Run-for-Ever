### Files

#### Source code

All text files have to be in UTF-8 (without BOM) encoding (generally UTF-8 on GNU/Linux and ISO 8859-15 on Windows) and LF character newline (sometime called UNIX newline/endline) (Windows generally used CRLF).

##### Coding style

We use english, so please use it everywhere in the project (messages, function names, doc, etc).

Names of variables, functions/methods, classes and everything else have to be clear, even if the name is a little longer.
You also do not have to forget to create documentation.

Following the PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) 20 is a good thing, even if the project does not use the Python language.

#### Text files

If you need to make a structured document, you should consider Markdown and of course HTML.
For example, this document uses the Markdown syntax.

#### Images, sounds and videos

Images, sounds and videos can be a lot of formats.
Each image, sound and video have to be in a at least one free/open format (known specifications, without patents and openable in 100% free/libre environment) and without DRM.
